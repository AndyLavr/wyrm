# Wyrm

Wyrm is a small library of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) powered SASS files meant
for use in minimalistic Document and Form heavy sites. It was primarily built
for [Webhook](http://www.webhook.com) but can also be found in use on
[Read the Docs sphinx theme](http://snide.github.com/sphinx_rtd_theme). Wyrm
is most similar to [purecss](http://www.purecss.io) in that it is not meant
to exist as a all-inclusive framework like [bootstrap](http://www.bootstrap.io)
but simply be a starting point for larger sass/bourbon projects.
