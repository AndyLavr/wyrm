The wyrm frontend is a collection of responsive, static assets that I use in my projects.
Inspired by Bootsrap and Foundation, Wyrm is most useful in documention and form heavy 
designs due to its clean, semi-flat sytle and its assortment of form based widgets.

What Wyrm is not
================

A layout or prototype builder. For the most part, Wyrm assumes that you'll build your menu and
layouts different per site. It doesn't include navigation elements or ways do deal with
content other than basic article formatting. Grids are done with Bourbon and Neat, but
it's easy enough to sub in your own.
